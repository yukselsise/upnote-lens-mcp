## About this fork

Measured against a real UpNote database (macOS, 225 notes, 2026-09-12):

- **WAL notes were invisible.** The connection used `immutable=1`, which tells SQLite to ignore the `-wal` file. UpNote runs in WAL mode and does not checkpoint on quit, so six days' worth of recent notes never showed up. Now `mode=ro`, still read-only, writes still rejected.
- **Notebook and tag tools silently returned nothing.** `notebooks.notes` is `[]` for all 16 notebooks and `tags.notes` is `[]` for all 1137 tags in this version. The real links live in `lists` (`notebooks_<id>` rows) and in `notes.tagLinks` (slug form). Notebook counts went from 0 to 219 notes, tags from 0 to 1014 in use.
- **Turkish-aware search.** SQLite `LIKE` folds case for ASCII only, so `İstanbul` never matched `istanbul`. Matching moved into Python; `fuzzy=True` also drops diacritics.
- **Note size is capped.** `create_note` rejects content over 256 KB instead of failing at the OS level — `open` dies with `Argument list too long` past ~1 MB of percent-encoded URL.
- **New `supersede_note` tool.** Writes a new version as a separate note in the same notebook, waits for it to appear in the database, then opens the old one for you to delete by hand. It never modifies or deletes the old note.

- **`mcp` is pinned to `<2`.** Resolving freely pulls mcp 2.x, where `FastMCP` was renamed and the server fails to import at all. Migrating to the 2.x API is still open.

See `docs/` for the measurements and `CLAUDE.md` for the schema facts.

A hybrid MCP server that lets your AI assistant work with your UpNote notes:

- **🔍 Find & search** notes by keyword across titles and bodies.
- **📖 Read & summarize** — it returns the *actual note text*, so the AI can
  summarize, analyze, or answer questions about what you've written.
- **✍️ Create** new notes from the chat.

Under the hood: reads come from the local UpNote SQLite database (**read-only**),
so real content comes back as text; writes go through the `upnote://` URL scheme
(x-callback-url) and **never touch the database**.

> The write side (URL scheme) is based on [chadthornton/upnote-mcp](https://github.com/chadthornton/upnote-mcp) (MIT).

## Usage

Once it's registered, just talk to your AI assistant in plain language — it
picks the right tool for you. No commands or syntax to memorize. For example:

- "Summarize my UpNote notes about the Q3 roadmap."
- "Find notes where I mentioned Postgres tuning and pull out the key points."
- "What did I write about onboarding last month?"
- "Show me my 5 most recent notes."
- "Create a note titled 'Standup 6/4' with today's three priorities."

Reading, searching, summarizing, and creating all happen through natural
conversation.

## Requirements

- **macOS** — fully supported and verified.
- **Windows** — best-effort. URLs launch through the registered scheme handler,
  and the default DB path is guessed under `%APPDATA%\UpNote\`. This path is
  **not verified** by the author — if reads fail, set `UPNOTE_LENS_DB` (see below).
- Python 3.10+ (or just [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which brings its own).
- UpNote desktop app installed.

## Install & register

### 🤖 Let AI install it (easiest)

Give your MCP client (Claude, etc.) a link to
[`llms-install.md`](llms-install.md) and it will run the steps and set everything
up for you.

### 🧑 Install it yourself

Pick the first option that fits what you already have. Each option includes how
to register it in Claude.

> **Claude Desktop config file** (referenced in each option):
> - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
> - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

#### Option 1 — with uv (recommended)

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed once
(`brew install uv`, or `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`).
After that there's **no package install step** — `uvx` downloads, caches, and
runs upnote-lens-mcp on demand.

Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add upnote-lens -- uvx upnote-lens-mcp
```
Claude Desktop:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "upnote-lens": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["upnote-lens-mcp"] } } }
```

#### Option 2 — with pip (if you don't have uv)

```bash
pip install upnote-lens-mcp
```

Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add upnote-lens -- upnote-lens-mcp
```
Claude Desktop:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "upnote-lens": { "command": "upnote-lens-mcp" } } }
```

#### Option 3 — from GitHub over HTTPS (if you don't have pip)

When you can't use PyPI/pip, install straight from the repo with uv. (No uv yet?
`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`.)

Claude Code:
```bash
claude mcp add upnote-lens -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/AwesomeHye/upnote-lens-mcp upnote-lens-mcp
```
Claude Desktop:
```json
{ "mcpServers": { "upnote-lens": { "command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/AwesomeHye/upnote-lens-mcp", "upnote-lens-mcp"] } } }
```

## Tools

### Read (queries the local DB → returns real text)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_notes(query, limit=20)` | Substring search over title/body. Returns id, title, updated time, snippet |
| `get_note(note_id, include_html=False)` | Full title + body text of a note (optionally raw HTML) |
| `list_recent(limit=20)` | Most recently updated notes |
| `list_notebooks()` | Notebooks with note counts and parent |
| `list_notes_in_notebook(notebook_id, limit=50)` | Notes inside a notebook |
| `list_tags()` | Tags with note counts |
| `list_notes_by_tag(tag_title, limit=50)` | Notes carrying a tag |

### Write (`upnote://` URL scheme)

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `create_note(title, content, notebook?, markdown=True, new_window=False)` | Create a note. `content` is Markdown by default. `notebook` matches by name. **Tags can't be set** (see below) |
| `open_note(note_id, new_window=False)` | Open an existing note in the app |
| `open_notebook(notebook_id)` | Open a notebook in the app |

> **Tag limitation**: UpNote's `note/new` URL scheme has no tag parameter, and
> hashtags placed in the body stay as plain text rather than becoming real tags
> (they only convert to tags when typed in the editor). If you need tags, add
> them manually in the app after the note is created.

## Override the DB path

If the database isn't in the default location (or you're on Windows), point at it
with an environment variable:

```
UPNOTE_LENS_DB=/path/to/upnote.sqlite3
```

Default paths:
- macOS: `~/Library/Containers/com.getupnote.desktop/Data/Library/Application Support/UpNote/upnote.sqlite3`
- Windows (best guess): `%APPDATA%\UpNote\upnote.sqlite3`
